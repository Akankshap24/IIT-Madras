## Programming Languages

- A way to communicate with computers using instructions.  
- In the beginning, closely linked to how computers work internally.  
- Computers store values in memory and use registers for calculations.  
- **Basic steps:**  
  1. Load a value from memory into a register.  
  2. Perform an operation (like addition).  
  3. Store the result back in memory.  
- This process was complex and prone to errors.  
- To make coding easier, high-level languages were created.
