## 💻 Programming Languages  

- A way to communicate with computers using instructions.  
- In the beginning, closely linked to how computers work internally.  
- Computers store values in memory and use registers for calculations.  
- **Basic steps:**  
  1. Load a value from memory into a register.  
  2. Perform an operation (like addition).  
  3. Store the result back in memory.  
- ⚠️ This process was complex and prone to errors.  
- 🚀 High-level languages were created to make coding easier.  

## 🧠 Abstraction in Programming  

- **What is Abstraction?**  
  - A way to simplify complex concepts in computational thinking.  

- **Common Abstractions:**  
  - Assigning values to **variables**.  
  - Using **conditional statements** (if-else).  
  - **Loops** for iteration (for, while).  
  - 🛠️ **Functions & recursion** to reuse code.  
  - 📦 **Data structures** like arrays, lists, and dictionaries.  

- **From High-Level to Low-Level:**  
  - Programming languages express these abstract ideas.  
  - 🔄 **Compilers & interpreters** translate high-level code into machine language.  
  - ⚖️ **Trade-off:** More abstraction means less control over hardware but fewer errors.  


### Styles of Programming  

#### ⚡ Imperative vs. Declarative  

| Feature             | 🏗️ Imperative Programming | 🎯 Declarative Programming |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Focus**          | How to compute            | What the computation should produce |
| **Approach**       | Step-by-step instructions | Defines results in terms of smaller computations |
| **Usage**          | Uses loops, conditionals  | Uses functions and transformations |
| **Intermediate Variables** | Commonly used | Typically avoided |
| **Example**        | Procedural languages (C, Java) | Functional languages (Haskell, SQL) |
